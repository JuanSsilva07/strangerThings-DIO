# strangerThings-DIO
It was a practical project carried out live in partnership with the DIO platform, with the intention of developing a landing page from scratch, exercising all the knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS with specialists in the area, developing from the semantics and accessibility of HTML as well as animations with CSS and JS.   It was also practiced creating a 100% functional form, using JS to integrate with a database quickly created in Firebase.  The page has a soundtrack that does justice to the series it was based on, and there is also the "Inverted World" effect, which is the major landmark of the series and could not be left out of a project like this.
